# Bomberman

### This is a Python implementation of the Bomberman game. The game simulates a rectangular grid where each cell can contain a bomb or be empty. Bombs can be planted in any cell, and after 3 seconds, they will detonate and destroy everything in their four neighboring cells. The game is played by a character called Bomberman, who can move freely through the grid and is immune to bombs.
